## Overview

Cardumen (Spanish for School of Fish) is a simulation tool designed to model the schooling and shoaling behaviors of fish. This repository provides an interactive environment for researchers, students, and enthusiasts to study and visualize the dynamics of group behavior in aquatic ecosystems and Multiple agent interactions.

## Features

- **Schooling Simulation**: Simulates synchronized movements of fish groups belonging to the same species.
- **Shoaling Behavior**: Models interaction and formation of groups involving different species.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust group size, speed, alignment, attraction, and separation distances.
- **Visualizations**: Dynamic graphical outputs illustrating fish movements and interactions in real time.
- **OOP Interface**: Implemented using object oriented programming.
